# **Overview**

Nusa Guide is a project developed by my team and me as a final project for Infinite Learning. This project is designed to offer users a seamless experience in browsing and booking travel tours. My role in this project was as a frontend developer, responsible for creating a dynamic and user-friendly interface.

## The Tech Stack

For this project, I chose to use the following technologies:

- React.js: For building the dynamic user interface.
- Node.js & Express.js: For server-side logic and RESTful API development.
- MySQL: For storing and managing data.
- JWT & Cookies: For authentication and session management (Note: Cookie management is yet to be completed).

## Features

- Browse Travel Circuits: Users can explore detailed information about various travel circuits.
- Book Travel Tours: Users can easily book travel tours.
- Search Functionality: Users can search for trips based on specific criteria.
- Reviews: Users can leave reviews for tours.
- User Authentication and Profile Management: Secure login and registration for users, along with profile management.

## Conclusion

Nusa Guide provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for browsing and booking travel tours. It combines robust backend functionality with a dynamic frontend to deliver a seamless user experience. Despite the cookie management feature still being in progress, the project successfully meets its primary goals. My contribution to this project was focused on frontend development, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.
